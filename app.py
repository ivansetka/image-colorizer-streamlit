        # Deep Learning Image Colorizer
    
        This application allows you to upload your own grayscale image and apply one of several deep learning models to 
        automatically colorize it. The models featured here are based on convolutional, adversarial, 
        diffusion, and transformer architectures.

        They were developed and trained as part of a thesis project focused on generative approaches to 
        image colorization. The goal was to evaluate their performance on both standard datasets and historical
        black-and-white photos. For more details, see the repository linked below ‚¨áÔ∏è
